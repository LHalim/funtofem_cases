 ...Stopping in plane_symmetry_geometry.
 There are two likely reasons for this message:
 1) Multiple symmetry-plane boundaries have been grouped into one (either in the grid itself or via "lumping")
    FUN3D requires that each symmetry plane be a distinct boundary
 2) A symmetry plane must have one coordinate constant on the plane. Some points on on the symmetry
    boundary differ from the average computed value of this coordinate by more than the tolerance above
